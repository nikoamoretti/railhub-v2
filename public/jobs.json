If you are passionate about contributing to a dynamic team and being at the heart of the railroad industry, we invite you to join us on this exciting journey. We are powered by our people, will you join our Train Crew team?\nTrain Crew employees are responsible for providing the safe and timely movement of customers’ freight. Previous railroad experience is not required as we provide all necessary training.\nAs you progress in your career, you may have the opportunity to apply for engine service (fireman’s class) and become a Class 1 Locomotive Engineer.\nIn your initial year of service, you can expect earnings of around $80,000. As you advance in your career there is potential for higher earnings, with the median annual wages of an employee with five years of service reaching over $100,000. Each employee is entitled to medical insurance that also covers prescriptions. In addition, the company provides vision, dental, life, and disability insurance.\nWhat Should You Know\nIf hired, know that changing seniority locations and/or crafts (moving from train crew to mechanical or engineering) are approved based on business demands and may not be granted.  Plan to commit to your craft and work location for a minimum of 2 years.\nThe training class is 14 weeks and includes classroom and on-the-job training.  Attendance for the full 14 weeks and successful completion of all exams during the training period is a requirement for continued employment.\nAfter training, you will work either road or yard service based on the territory you hold seniority and seniority date.\nRoad service crews may be required to work between two locations requiring them to stay away from their home terminal point.  Lodging is provided by Union Pacific.\nYard and local service crews work with an engineer, or by remote control. They classify (sort) the cars from inbound trains and build outbound trains.\nThis is a seniority-based position, and you may be required to cover locations within the area you hold seniority other than the location hired. These locations could be a long distance from the location you were hired or from where you live. Lodging may or may not be provided depending on the collective bargaining agreement you are working under.\nYou may be required to work an assignment that is on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\nYou will likely not be eligible for compensated time off during your first year of employment aside from paid sick days.\nTemporary furloughs are possible depending on fluctuations in business volumes. Furloughs and subsequent recalls to work are based on seniority dates.\nUnion Pacific does not tolerate the use of drugs and alcohol (even for medicinal purposes).
